How similar was your plan to the final program? Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?
My MVP plan was similar to my final ruby program.
Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle? Or are any of your classes doing too much?
Each of my classes follow single Responsibility and makes it easy to understand the flow of data. It was difficult to grasp at the beginning but I like I am making a progress.

Did you practice TDD?
Yes- I wrote a test for every method.

Are each of your methods tested? Did you find anything difficult to test?
I find it difficult to translate pseudocode to Ruby code and also how to think as a programmer.
